              <b className="hightText1">Insertion sort</b> is a simple sorting algorithm that works by
              repeatedly dividing the input into sorted and unsorted portions.
              It starts with an empty sorted portion and gradually inserts
              each element from the unsorted portion into its correct position
              within the sorted portion. The algorithm iterates through the
              unsorted portion, comparing each element with the elements in
              the sorted portion and shifting them to the right until the
              correct position is found. This process continues until all
              elements are inserted into their proper places.
